# Afronteira Websitee - WordPress Docker Compose

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)

## Installation

Open a terminal and `cd` to the folder in which `docker-compose.yml` is saved and run:

```
docker-compose up
```

This creates two new folders next to your `docker-compose.yml` file.

* `wp-data` – used to store and restore database dumps
* `wp-app` – the location of your WordPress application

The containers are now built and running. You should be able to access the WordPress installation with the configured IP in the browser address. By default it is `http://127.0.0.1`.

For convenience you may add a new entry into your hosts file.

## Usage

### Starting containers

You can start the containers with the `up` command in daemon mode (by adding `-d` as an argument) or by using the `start` command:

```
docker-compose start
```

### Stopping containers

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Removing containers

To stop and remove all the containers use the`down` command:

```
docker-compose down
```

Use `-v` if you need to remove the database volume which is used to persist the database:

```
docker-compose down -v
```

### Project from existing source

Copy the `docker-compose.yml` file into a new directory. In the directory you create two folders:

* `wp-data` – here you add the database dump
* `wp-app` – here you copy your existing WordPress code

You can now use the `up` command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will create the containers and populate the database with the given dump. You may set your host entry and change it in the database, or you simply overwrite it in `wp-config.php` by adding:

```
define('WP_HOME','http://wp-app.local');
define('WP_SITEURL','http://wp-app.local');
```

### Creating database dumps

```
./export.sh
```

### Developing a Theme

Configure the volume to load the theme in the container in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```
volumes:
  - ./theme-name/trunk/:/var/www/html/wp-content/themes/theme-name
```

### Developing a Plugin

Configure the volume to load the plugin in the container in the `docker-compose.yml`:

```
volumes:
  - ./plugin-name/trunk/:/var/www/html/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name
```

### WP CLI

The docker compose configuration also provides a service for using the [WordPress CLI](https://developer.wordpress.org/cli/commands/).

Sample command to install WordPress:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli core install --url=http://localhost --title=test --admin_user=admin --admin_email=test@example.com
```

Or to list installed plugins:

```
docker-compose run --rm wpcli plugin list
```

For an easier usage you may consider adding an alias for the CLI:

```
alias wp="docker-compose run --rm wpcli"
```

This way you can use the CLI command above as follows:

```
wp plugin list
```

### phpMyAdmin

You can also visit `http://127.0.0.1:8080` to access phpMyAdmin after starting the containers.

The default username is `root`, and the password is the same as supplied in the `.env` file.
